    <string name="instructionsP1">This is a very simple Math Game directed at middle and high school students.
        The game challenges and builds students cognitive ability by solving a simple math question, locating
        the moving answer and selecting it within a given amount of time. The speed of the moving answers
        increases every time a student selects the correct answer.
    </string>
    <string name="instructionsP2">
        The game begins with a 3 second count down. The student has a limited amount of time to select
        the bubble containing the answer depending on the difficulty set in the settings. If bubbles overlap than give the phone a shake and the bubbles will disperse.
        When a player eventually runs out of time, he is given a chance to save his score to a leaderboard and to
        share on twitter.
